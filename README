This is the release of the code base developed by Jesse Weaver for
experiments in doctoral dissertation.  Very little documentation is
provided, but I (Jesse Weaver) got tired of telling people that I would
open source this code as soon as I had time to document it... a time that
never seems to come around.

An earlier version of this code was released, referred to as version 0.1.
It is available at http://github.com/jrweave/jrweave .  Let's call this
version 0.2.
